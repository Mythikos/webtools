# WebTools
A collection of tools created for web analysis to be used within the .NET environment.

## Why?
I have seen many tools that exist in the world for web analysis, recon, exploitation, etc but most of them are created with the intent to run in the Linux ecosystem. As a Windows & .NET developer, with interests in red and blue team activities, I wanted a set of tools that would work in my native ecosystem. With that said, WebTools was born.

## Whats in this repo?
In this repo, you will find a collection of the tools that I have added to the WebTools toolset. I plan to add more over time and increase the features of each individual tool as I go. At the moment there is no roadmap, it's purely what I decide to add next.
